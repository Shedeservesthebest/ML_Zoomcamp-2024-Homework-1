Laptop Prices Analysis - Python Homework
This repository contains my  ML_Zoomcamp homework focused on data analysis and linear regression using Python. The assignment involves setting up the Python environment, working with the Pandas library, and performing various data manipulations on a dataset containing laptop prices.

Key Objectives:

Environment Setup:
Installation of essential Python packages: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Data Exploration:
Loading and inspecting the "Laptops Price" dataset.
Determining the version of Pandas used in the environment.
Counting the number of records and laptop brands in the dataset.
Identifying columns with missing values.
Data Analysis:
Finding the maximum final price for Dell laptops.
Calculating the median and mode of the Screen column, and analyzing the impact of filling missing values.
Linear Regression Implementation:
Extracting specific features (RAM, Storage, Screen) for "Innjoo" laptops.
Performing matrix operations to compute the sum of weights, effectively implementing a simple linear regression.
This assignment serves as an introduction to basic data manipulation techniques using Pandas, as well as a hands-on exercise in linear regression.
